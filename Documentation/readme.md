# Documentation and Presentations #

This folder contains the following documentation:
*  We've an extensive set of PowerPoint decks ready for your consumption. Feel free to use the material in anyway you need while talking about the app model transition. We will be updating these gradually based on the work the PnP core team members do with customers, but also feel free to extend and update the decks by yourself as well. We are simply looking to have one location for generic slides on this topic, which can be then easily used to create presentations for customers, seminars and web casts
*  The latest version of the [MSDN released](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42030) SharePoint 2013 and SharePoint Online solution packs. The SharePoint 2013 and SharePoint Online solution packs contain code samples and documentation that demonstrate how to: 
    *  use site branding and site provisioning techniques
    *  create and use UX components
    *  address search customization scenarios
    *  customize enterprise content management 
    *  create composite business applications
