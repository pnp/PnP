This folder contains tools and scripts that are used to help with **transforming** deployed FTC elements to it's app model counterparts. 

We'll have **discovery tools and scripts** that will help you get a view on where which FTC reference exists (e.g. you do want to know which sites use that custom master page that was deployed as FTC solution). 

Second dimension is the actual **transformation tools and scripts**. E.g. a PowerShell cmdlet that can be used to point a set of sites and sub sites to an OOB master page.
