# jQuery extensions for SharePoint Add-Ins #

### Summary ###
This project contains a set of jQuery extensions, described below, to enable extending SharePoint functionality to provider hosted apps using the familiar jQuery syntax. The currently available extensions are:

 - sp.addChome.js - adds the SharePoint chrome controls
 - sp.peoplePicker.js - adds a people picker control
 - sp.documentPicker.js - adds a document picker control

### Prerequisites ###
It's important that the provider hosted Add-In that's running the document picker is using the same IE security zone as the SharePoint site it's installed on. If you get "Sorry we had trouble accessing your site" errors then please check this.
