This application sample demonstrates how to perform JavaScript embedding to update SharePoint sites, using the JavaScript Object Model and a SharePoint Hosted Add-In. 
This approach is preferred over customizing the Master Page.

***Notice**. Techniques shown in this sample do require full permission to web or site collection level, so this is not a suitable model for apps designed to be distributed from the SharePoint store.*
