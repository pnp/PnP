# Outlook Notifications REST API with ASP.NET Web API #

### Summary ###
This is a sample of an ASP.NET Web API project validating and responding to Outlook Notifications - created with the Outlook Notifications REST API. The sample covers the concept of subscribing for notifications, validating notification URLs and inspecting the monitoried entities by calling the Outlook REST API using persisted tokens.

You can learn more about the Outlook Notifications REST API and its operations at: <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/office365/api/notify-rest-operations>

Using this event driven approach is a much more solid way of dealing with changes in the resources and entities in Outlook. As opposed to polling the Outlook REST APIs directly, this is much more lightweight (especially when the amount of items is large). With scale, this approach becomes essential for a sustainable service architecture.

### Prerequisites ###
The Outlook Notifications REST API is available for multiple services. You will need to register your app before you can make any calls towards the Outlook Notifcations REST API. Find more information: <https://dev.outlook.com/RestGettingStarted>

If you are building for Office 365 and you're missing an Office 365 tenant - get yourself a developer account at: <http://dev.office.com/devprogram>

Lastly, you will need to host and deploy your Web API, for instance to a web app on Microsoft Azure: <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/scenarios/web-app/>.

# How to Use? #
The first step is to create and host your Web API somewhere – it needs to be deployed and validated by the Outlook Notifications REST API before we can get notifications sent to it. In terms of validation, it’s pretty straight forward. When we ask the Outlook Notifications REST API to start sending notifications (by creating a subscription) to your Web API – it will go ahead and send a validation token to it. 

The Web API needs to respond with the same validation token within 5 seconds, if it can achieve that – a subscription for notifications will be created and returned to the client application (creating the subscription).

#### Register in Azure AD ####

Your first step is to register your web application in your Azure AD tenant (associated with your Office 365 tenant). The web application is using OWIN and OpenID Connect to handle authentication and authorization.You can find more details about OWIN and OpenId Connect here, as well as about registering you app on the Azure AD tenant here: <http://www.cloudidentity.com/blog/2014/07/28/protecting-an-mvc4-vs2012-project-with-openid-connect-and-azure-ad/>

Since the application is calling back into Office 365 it's important to grant it permissions to read the user's calendar.

When you have registered your web application in Azure AD - you will have to configure the following settings in the Web.config file:

    <add key="ida:ClientId" value="[YOUR APPLICATION CLIENT ID]" />
    <add key="ida:ClientSecret" value="[YOUR APPLICATION CLIENT SECRET]" />
    <add key="ida:Domain" value="[YOUR DOMAIN]" />
    <add key="ida:TenantId" value="[YOUR TENANT ID]" />
    <add key="ida:PostLogoutRedirectUri" value="[YOUR POST LOGOUT REDIRECT URI]" />
    
#### Deploy ####

Deploy your Web API to a hosting provider, for instance a web app on Microsoft Azure: <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/scenarios/web-app/>. Note that this application requires an SQL Azure server as the subscription and token information is maintained in a database. You can use the publish wizard in Visual Studio and publish a new web app + DB server. If you already created the web app or want to use an existing SQL Azure database server you need to download the publishing profile from the web app and use that in the publish wizard. Also ensure you set your database connection string to point to your existing SQL Azure server like shown below:

```XML
<add name="DefaultConnection" connectionString="Data Source=tcp:<sqlazuredbserver>.database.windows.net;Initial Catalog=OutlookNotifications;User ID=user@<sqlazuredbserver>;Password=*****" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
```

Once you have deployed the sample to a hosting provider; configure a breakpoint to catch and validate the flow in the Web API (NotifyController). After the validation occurs, you will receive notifications and be able to investigate the responses.

You can use Visual Studio 2015 to attach a debugger to an Azure web app (see <https://azure.microsoft.com/sv-se/documentation/articles/web-sites-dotnet-troubleshoot-visual-studio/#remotedebug>)

**Be aware: if you are using remote debugging, delays may cause you to break the 5 second response time when validating notification URLs.**

Navigate to your hosted sample and click on the "Register Subscription" button to start getting notifications.

# Response Models #
The sample implements a few response models. They serve to help out when dealing with the notification requests (parsing the received JSON). Listed here are the key response models used in the sample. 

The generic ResponseModel class is the main container for the response itself. In the sample it will contain a collection of the NotificationModel class.

```C#
public class ResponseModel<T>
{
    public List<T> Value { get; set; }
}
```
The NotificationModel class represents the notification sent to your listener service (Web API).

```C#
public class NotificationModel
{
    public string SubscriptionId { get; set; }
    public string SubscriptionExpirationDateTime { get; set; }
    public int SequenceNumber { get; set; }
    public string ChangeType { get; set; }
    public string Resource { get; set; }
    public ResourceDataModel ResourceData { get; set; }
}
```
The ResourceDataModel class represents the entity (i.e. mail, contact, event) that has triggered a change. This is a navigation property. 

```C#
public class ResourceDataModel
{
    public string Id { get; set; }
}
```
The PushSubscriptionModel class represents the subscription entity. This is used both as a request and response model when creating the subscription.
```C#
public class PushSubscriptionModel
{
    [JsonProperty("@odata.type")]
    public string Type
    {
        get
        {
            return "#Microsoft.OutlookServices.PushSubscription";
        }
    }

    [JsonProperty(NullValueHandling = NullValueHandling.Ignore)]
    public string Id { get; set; }
    public string Resource { get; set; }
    public string NotificationURL { get; set; }
    public string ChangeType { get; set; }
    public Guid ClientState { get; set; }
    [JsonProperty(NullValueHandling = NullValueHandling.Ignore)]
    public string SubscriptionExpirationDateTime { get; set; }
}
```

# Web API Controller #
The NotifyController implements a single POST method. Both the validation and notification requests will be sent as POST messages to your Web API.

As for the validation token, it will accept it as an optional parameter. If it’s present in the request, we know that a validation of the URL (Web API) is happening. If not, we can assume that we’re getting a notification from an active subscription.
So if a validation token parameter is present, we return it right away in the proper way – by setting the content type header to text/plain and return HTTP 200 as the response code.

As for no present validation token in the request, we can start parsing the request body and look for notifications. 

```C#
public async Task<HttpResponseMessage> Post(string validationToken = null)
{
    // If a validation token is present, we need to respond within 5 seconds.
    if (validationToken != null)
    {
        var response = Request.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.OK);
        response.Content = new StringContent(validationToken);
        return response;
    }

    // Present only if the client specified the ClientState property in the 
    // subscription request. 
    IEnumerable<string> clientStateValues;
    Request.Headers.TryGetValues("ClientState", out clientStateValues);

    if (clientStateValues != null)
    {
        var clientState = clientStateValues.ToList().FirstOrDefault();
        if (clientState != null)
        {
            // TODO: Use the client state to verify the legitimacy of the notification.
        }
    }

    // Read and parse the request body.
    var content = await Request.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
    var notifications = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<ResponseModel<NotificationModel>>(content);

    // TODO: Do something with the notification.

    return new HttpResponseMessage(HttpStatusCode.OK);
}
```

I recommend you to pay attention to the client state header in the request (named ClientState). If you create the subscription with a client state property, it will be passed along with the notification request. This way you can verify the legitimacy of the notification.

In addition, this sample also inspects the monitored items (created calendar events) when a notification is triggered by calling the Outlook REST API using a persisted token.

```C#
// Read and parse the request body.
var content = await Request.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
var notifications = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<ResponseModel<NotificationModel>>(content).Value;

// TODO: Do something with the notification.
var entities = new ApplicationDbContext();
foreach (var notification in notifications)
{
    // Get the subscription from the database in order to locate the
    // user identifiers. This is used to tap the token cache.
    var subscription = entities.SubscriptionList.FirstOrDefault(s =>
        s.SubscriptionId == notification.SubscriptionId);

    try
    {
        // Get an access token to use when calling the Outlook REST APIs.
        var token = await TokenHelper.GetTokenForApplicationAsync(
            subscription.SignedInUserID,
            subscription.TenantID,
            subscription.UserObjectID,
            TokenHelper.OutlookResourceID);
        var httpClient = new HttpClient();
        httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", token);

        // Send a GET call to the monitored event.
        var responseString = await httpClient.GetStringAsync(notification.Resource);
        var calendarEvent = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<CalendarEventModel>(responseString);

        // TODO: Do something with the calendar event.
    }
    catch (AdalException)
    {
        // TODO: Handle token error.
    }
    // If the above failed, the user needs to explicitly re-authenticate for 
    // the app to obtain the required token.
    catch (Exception)
    {
        // TODO: Handle exception.
    }
}
```
